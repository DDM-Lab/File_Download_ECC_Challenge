TODO Saketh: write a README with python version, and other relevant information to run this

Thoughs:

- Provide a better explanation of what the user is downloading and why. For example: 
> "Download the encrypted files from the server of your choice to begin the challenge."
- At the beginning, inform users that they can switch servers at any time but warn them about the potential consequences  b:
> Message: "You can switch servers at any point during the download, but doing so will reset your progress. Choose wisely!"
- Before switching, ask for confirmation (suggestion):
> Message: "Switching servers will reset your download progress. Are you sure you want to switch? (yes/no)"
- At the end, we should have the time they took when the throttling began and if they switched:

```Download Analysis:
- Total Download Time: 45 seconds
- Number of Server Switches: 0
- Throttling began at: 80%```
